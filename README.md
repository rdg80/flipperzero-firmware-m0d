# About
This is just me trying to learn new stuff like (git, GitHub, WSL, GitKraken, Docker, VS code, C...)
I had countless hours of "rabbit hole" searching, googling, uninstalling, reinstalling, more researching, flashing, re-flashing, DFU mode, reboot, hard DFU, and more researching, etc.  And it was... and still is FUN!  It's not much, but I'm still learning...

I modified files to make things look and feel cleaner -- to my liking.

### Some of the changes:
- removed flappy bird (kept crashing on me)
- adjusted the spelling of "Univeral Remote" to "Universal Remote" (typo)
- added the Universal Remote (aka Sub-GHz Remote) back to main menu
- added TouchTunes back to main menu (thank you jimi for the wonderful code)
- added vibrate and light indication during transmit (thank you shitpost simulator for the code assistance)
- removed the UniRFremix remote (love the interface look, but was a bit to buggy for me)
