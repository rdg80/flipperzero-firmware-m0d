# About
This is just me trying to learn new stuff like (git, GitHub, WSL, GitKraken, Docker, VS code, C...)
I had countless hours of "rabbit hole" searching, googling, uninstalling, reinstalling, more researching, flashing, re-flashing, DFU mode, reboot, hard DFU, and more researching, etc.  And it was... and still is FUN!  It's not much, but I'm still learning...

I modified files to make things look and feel cleaner -- to my liking.
